# SAGE---Simulink-Analysis-and-Graph-Evaluation
SAGE is a standalone C++17 tool for parsing and diffing Simulink .slx models without relying on MATLAB or Simulink. It enables developers to inspect and compare model structures programmatically, making it ideal for automation, version control, and CI/CD workflows in model-based development environments.
